Integration (Upload parsing, JD flow, export). 5. Testing (Unit stubs: Mock RAG sim with sample data, parse sample PDF text, form validation). Include key code snippets (React components, Node routes, Gemini prompts). End with deploy checklist (env vars for APIs). Keep UI code ultra-minimal—no extras."
