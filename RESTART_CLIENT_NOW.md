# STOP AND RESTART THE CLIENT NOW

The Tailwind config has been fixed. 

**You MUST restart the dev server:**

1. Go to the client terminal
2. Press Ctrl+C to stop it
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Wait for it to fully load
5. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R for hard refresh)

The UI will now show properly with:
- Centered login box (max-width 420px)
- Proper spacing
- Clean black/gray/white design
- Normal-sized buttons
- Visible text inputs with borders
